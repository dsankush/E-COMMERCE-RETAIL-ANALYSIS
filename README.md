# E-COMMERCE-RETAIL-ANALYSIS


An e-commerce retailer is distinct from a  traditional retailer. Normally, a buyer may  examine and evaluate a product before  purchasing. The client does not have the  option to physically examine the product  before making a purchase in an e-commerce  ecosystem. The kind of goods that is sent to  the consumer is beyond of their control.
Therefore, online retailer must sell the goods  exactly as described in order to operate a  successful online business.
